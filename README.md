# Project Overview
**Mon vieux grimoire** allows users to interact with a collection of books, rate them, and manage their own submissions. Users can create accounts, log in, upload books, and rate others. Only the uploader of a book can delete or edit their submissions. The front-end is built with React, providing a dynamic user interface, while the back-end handles data operations and authentication using Express and MongoDB.

# Features
* **User Authentication** : Create an account and log in to the site.
* **Book Management** : Upload books, rate other users books, and view the top 3 highest-rated books.
* **Edit/Delete** : Edit or delete your own book uploads if logged in.
* **Top Rated Books** : Display the 3 highest-rated books for users to see.

# Technology used
## Frontend :
* **React** : A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  
## Backend :
* **Express** : A Node.js framework for building the server and API endpoints.
* **MongoDB** : A NoSQL database used to store book and user data.
